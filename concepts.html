<h1>Concepts in fmu-ensemble<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts-in-fmu-ensemble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are some concepts in fmu-ensemble that one needs to understand
at some point</p>
<div class="section" id="realization">
<h2>Realization<a class="headerlink" href="#realization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A realization is a single model run. It usually includes one Eclipse
run, but that is not a requirement. As long as you have a done some
computational job that has left some (supported) files on the
filesystem, it can be possible to load results from the realization
using fmu-ensemble.</p>
<div class="section" id="scratchrealization">
<h3>ScratchRealization<a class="headerlink" href="#scratchrealization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The class <cite>ScratchRealization</cite> is a Python object that can load
realization results (and input) from the filesystem from a <em>single</em>
realization, typically located on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/scratch</span></code>. You can ask the object
to load and thereby <em>internalize</em> data, with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_*()</span></code>
functions. The internalization is an important concept. All data that
you internalize will be stored in the object, it can be easily
reaccessed, statistics can be computed. The object is tied to the
filesystem, and will become unstable if files are deleted from
disk. If you need some persistence of the object, it must be converted
to a VirtualRealization (see below)</p>
<p>Additionally, you may find <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_*()</span></code> functions that can access certain
datatypes. Common for these is that they will <em>not</em> modify the object,
it is a read-once operation. This is particularly relevant for Eclipse
summary data, where you at different times may ask for different
subsets and at different sampling frequencies, but do not want to
internalize all the data into the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualrealization">
<h3>VirtualRealization<a class="headerlink" href="#virtualrealization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <cite>VirtualRealization</cite> is typically a <cite>ScratchRealization</cite> where you
have removed the tie to the location on the original filesystem.  The
VirtualRealization object only knows of the data that was internalized
while being a ScratchRealization, and the main access function is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_df()</span></code>. When a realization is a ScratchRealization, you can
always ask for any time-resolution for Eclipse data, or any other CSV
file that the scratch directory contains. A VirtualRealization will
have to interpolate if you ask for daily summary data, in case you
only internalized yearly or monthly before making a
VirtualRealization.</p>
<p>Another typical source for a virtual realization is a calculated
realization, either as a point-wise statistical aggregate of a
collection of realizations (ensemble), or maybe from a linear
combination of realizations (then coming from the object
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RealizationCombination</span></code>. The reason for naming this a
VirtualRealization is due to the possibility to handle computed
realizations fully analogous to ScratchRealizations.</p>
<p>Virtual realizations have features to write their internal data to
disk, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">to_disk()</span></code> feature. This can be used to store stripped down
versions of realizations, or to be able to store computed
realizations. You may both write to disk into a file structure that
would resemble the original realization (and you can edit the files if
you are bold enough). The virtual realization can later be
instantiated from the dumped disk structure by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_disk()</span></code>. Another
variant for storage is to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">to_json()</span></code> which will dump all data in
as a <em>json</em> datatype, for which there probably exists use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="realizationcombination">
<h3>RealizationCombination<a class="headerlink" href="#realizationcombination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The object <cite>RealizationCombination</cite> is an object that the user will
not observe directly, but it will work under the hood every time
arithmetic operations on realizations are done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ensemble">
<h2>Ensemble<a class="headerlink" href="#ensemble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An ensemble is a collection of realizations, where the realizations
share some common features making it relevant to do statistical
aggregations over them. This does not necessarily exclude random
collections of realizations, but if the realizations do not share
anything, they can always be collected in simple Python lists as well.</p>
<p>A requirement is that each member of the ensembled are referred to by
an <em>integer</em>, and will always be present in the column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">REAL</span></code> in
aggregated dataframes.</p>
<div class="section" id="scratchensemble">
<h3>ScratchEnsemble<a class="headerlink" href="#scratchensemble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <cite>ScratchEnsemble</cite> is an ensemble that is initialized from a
directory of realization-runs on the file system, typically on
<cite>/scratch</cite>. This object can do a full initialization of all
<cite>ScratchRealization</cite> in a specific directory, and collect them into a
ensemble object. The ScratchEnsemble object itself is very light, it
is more or less only a list of ScratchRealization objects, and support
functions for running operations on all of them. Whenever you ask for
an aggregated dataset, data aggregation over all realizations is
performed on the fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualensemble">
<h3>VirtualEnsemble<a class="headerlink" href="#virtualensemble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Analogous to the relationship between <cite>ScratchRealization</cite> and
<cite>VirtualRealization</cite>, a <cite>VirtualEnsemble</cite> is an ensemble with no
strings attached to the original filesystem. All data from its underlying
realizations is aggregated and full dataframes are stored. The object
is able to construct new <cite>VirtualRealization</cite> objects from its data, both
by picking by index, or from statistical aggregations.</p>
<p>You can ask a VirtualEnsemble for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_smry()</span></code> in which it will try its
best to locate internalized Eclipse summary data, and then interpolate the
data to your chosen time index. This is opposed to a ScratchEnsemble which
in that case would go back to the original binary files and give the correct
answer.</p>
<p>Since all data is aggregated, VirtualEnsembles may work faster than
ScratchEnsemble. The recommended procedure would then be to initialize
a ScratchEnsemble, internalize all data you need using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_*()</span></code>,
and then make a VirtualEnsemble object using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.to_virtual()</span></code>.  Also,
if you want to add additional ensemble data, aggregated by your own
ad-hoc code, you can only do that on VirtualEnsemble, which has an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.append()</span></code> function. It is also possible to replace existing
aggregated data in a VirtualEnsemble, for example making new summary
vectors that are combinations of other data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ensemblecombination">
<h3>EnsembleCombination<a class="headerlink" href="#ensemblecombination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you try do add or substract ensembles, the objects you get in
return are of type <cite>EnsembleCombination</cite>. These objects act as
ensembles, but its data is always a combination of the data in two or
more ensembles (or a single ensemble scaled by a scalar).</p>
<p>Calculating a combination of ensembles can be computationally
expensive, depending on the amount of data requested and included. The
actual combination of numbers is <em>not</em> done until you actually ask for
it. That means that initialization of <cite>EnsembleCombination</cite> is fast,
but when you ask for its data, it might take time. If you want all
data to be evaluated in one go, you ask the object for a
<cite>VirtualEnsemble</cite> using the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.to_virtual()</span></code>, which means that
all internalized data is evaluated and returned to you for further
access and/or storage.</p>
<p>The implementation of the linear algebra over ensembles and
realizations is accomplished using a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree">Binary Expression Tree</a>, with
<cite>ScratchEnsemble</cite> or <cite>VirtualEnsemble</cite> at the leaf nodes.</p>
